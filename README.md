# Sharding calculations

## Bandwidth
For a quick overview table with numerical values see [this notebook](bandwidth_table.ipynb).
An interactive version can be found here:

To explore the bandwidth requirements for the sharding scheme under different parameters in an interactive plot, open the following binder:
